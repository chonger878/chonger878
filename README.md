I have a BAS in Application Development.  I have a strong working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and MySQL.  I am currently learning Flask (and having fun doing so!)  My background is originally clerical work such as data entry, but I am transitioning into a tech career.  One of my motivations behind working in tech was that I found that writing codes is like solving a puzzle, which is also another activity I enjoy! My favorite language is MySQL.

Fun fact:  It was the show "Person of Interest" that piqued my interest in programming and inspired my decision to change careers.
