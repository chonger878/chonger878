I am currently learning full stack development at Coding Dojo. I have already a good foundation in terms of HTML, CSS, and MySQL.  I am currently learning Flask (and having fun doing so!)  My background is originally clerical work such as data entry, but I am transitioning into a tech career.  My favorite language is MySQL.

Fun fact:  It was the show "Person of Interest" that piqued my interest in programming and inspired my decision to change careers.
